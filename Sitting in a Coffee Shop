What Shall We Do Today?
-----------------------
* We might go to Lakeland to see the Hollis Garden
* We could go out for lunch
* We could go in to St. Pete's

There are several things we could do today.

The Coffee Shop 
---------------

The coffee shop is a sweet, kind of funky, "plein air" set up.
The servers are Florida-style hipsters who make a mean cup of java - any style you'd like.
Patrons have the option of sitting at a tiny "bar" or lounging on the veranda.
The veranda space is composed of lovely off-white wicker furniture with plush blue cushions.
It's a very chill space in which to work while sipping a cuppa.
